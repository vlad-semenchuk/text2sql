# Pull Request Creation System

Create intelligent pull requests from the current branch with auto-generated titles and descriptions based on commit
analysis.

## Usage

This command creates a PR from the current branch to a target branch. Examples:

- Create PR to main (default): `/pr`
- Create PR to specific branch: `/pr development`
- Create PR to feature branch: `/pr feature/base`

## Instructions:

Perform an intelligent pull request creation workflow with commit analysis and description generation:

## Workflow Overview:

1. **Pre-PR Validation**: Verify branch state and target branch existence
2. **Commit Analysis**: Compare commits between current and target branch
3. **Content Generation**: Generate PR title and description from commits
4. **PR Creation**: Create pull request using GitHub CLI
5. **Post-Creation Verification**: Confirm successful creation and display URL

### Step 1: Pre-PR Validation and Setup

```bash
# Extract target branch from command arguments (default to main if not provided)
# When user runs "/pr development", the first argument is "development"
TARGET_BRANCH=${1:-main}

# Verify clean working directory
git status --porcelain
```

**Validation Checks:**

- **Clean Working Directory**: Ensure no uncommitted changes exist
- **Current Branch**: Verify not on target branch
- **Target Branch Exists**: Confirm target branch exists locally or remotely
- **GitHub CLI Auth**: Verify gh is authenticated

**If uncommitted changes exist:**

```bash
echo "Working directory must be clean before creating PR"
echo "Options:"
echo "1. Commit changes: Use /commit command"
echo "2. Stash changes: git stash push -m 'pre-pr stash'"
echo "3. Reset changes: git reset --hard HEAD (DESTRUCTIVE)"
exit 1
```

**If on target branch:**

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "$TARGET_BRANCH" ]; then
    echo "Cannot create PR from target branch '$TARGET_BRANCH' to itself"
    echo "Switch to a feature branch first"
    exit 1
fi
```

**If target branch doesn't exist:**

```bash
git fetch origin
git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/$TARGET_BRANCH || {
    echo "Target branch '$TARGET_BRANCH' not found on remote"
    git branch -r | grep -E "(main|master|develop|development)"
    echo "Available target branches shown above"
    exit 1
}
```

### Step 2: Commit Analysis and Comparison

```bash
# Get current branch name
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Get commits that will be included in PR
git log --oneline origin/$TARGET_BRANCH..HEAD

# Get detailed commit information for analysis
git log --format="%h|%s|%b" origin/$TARGET_BRANCH..HEAD
```

**Commit Analysis Process:**

1. **Extract Commits**: Get all commits between target branch and current branch
2. **Parse Commit Messages**: Extract type, scope, and description from each commit
3. **Categorize Changes**: Group commits by type (feat, fix, refactor, docs, etc.)
4. **Identify Primary Change**: Determine the main purpose of the PR

**If no commits to include:**

```bash
COMMIT_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count origin/$TARGET_BRANCH..HEAD)
if [ "$COMMIT_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "No new commits to include in PR"
    echo "Current branch is up to date with $TARGET_BRANCH"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Step 3: PR Title Generation

**Title Generation Logic:**

Based on commit analysis, generate concise, descriptive titles:

- **Single Feature**: `feat: add user authentication system`
- **Single Fix**: `fix: resolve SQL injection vulnerability`
- **Multiple Related**: `feat: enhance text2sql conversion workflow`
- **Mixed Changes**: `refactor: improve database schema and validation`
- **Documentation**: `docs: update API documentation and examples`

**Title Format Rules:**

- Use primary commit type as prefix
- Maximum 50 characters
- Describe the main change or theme
- Use active voice and imperative mood
- Include component/module name when relevant

### Step 4: PR Description Generation

**Description Structure:**

```markdown
## Summary

â€¢ [Primary change description with specific components]
â€¢ [Secondary change if significantly different]
â€¢ [Additional change only if necessary - max 5 total]

## Changes by Type

### Features

- [List feature commits with brief descriptions]

### Bug Fixes

- [List fix commits with brief descriptions]

### Refactoring

- [List refactor commits with brief descriptions]

### Documentation

- [List docs commits with brief descriptions]
```

**Description Generation Rules:**

- **Concise Summary**: 1-3 bullet points covering main changes
- **Categorized Changes**: Group commits by type for clarity
- **Specific Components**: Mention affected modules, files, or services
- **Technology Context**: Reference NestJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL when relevant
- **No Assignees**: Don't assign reviewers or assignees

### Step 5: Branch Push and PR Creation

```bash
# Ensure current branch is pushed to remote
git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin $CURRENT_BRANCH || {
    echo "Pushing current branch to remote..."
    git push -u origin $CURRENT_BRANCH
}

# Generate PR title based on commit analysis
PR_TITLE="[generated title]"

# Create PR using GitHub CLI with HEREDOC for proper formatting
gh pr create --title "$PR_TITLE" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
[Generated summary based on commits]

## Changes by Type
[Categorized changes from commit analysis]
EOF
)"
```

**PR Creation Options:**

- **Title**: Auto-generated from commit analysis
- **Body**: Structured description with summary and categorized changes
- **Target Branch**: Specified target or default main
- **No Reviewers**: Leave reviewer assignment for manual selection
- **Labels**: Let project maintainers add appropriate labels

### Step 6: Post-Creation Verification

```bash
# Get the created PR URL
PR_URL=$(gh pr view --json url --jq '.url')

# Display success information
echo "âœ… Pull Request created successfully"
echo "ðŸ“‹ Title: $PR_TITLE"
echo "ðŸŽ¯ Target: $TARGET_BRANCH"
echo "ðŸ”— URL: $PR_URL"

# Show PR status
gh pr view --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName --jq '"PR #\(.number): \(.title)\nFrom: \(.headRefName)\nTo: \(.baseRefName)"'
```

**Verification Checklist:**

- âœ… PR created successfully on GitHub
- âœ… Title accurately reflects changes
- âœ… Description includes relevant details
- âœ… Target branch is correct
- âœ… All commits included in PR
- âœ… No automatic reviewer assignments

### Step 7: Additional GitHub CLI Integration

**Advanced PR Operations:**

```bash
# View PR in browser (optional)
gh pr view --web

# Check PR status and checks
gh pr checks

# View PR diff
gh pr diff
```

## Commit Message Analysis Patterns

### Pattern Recognition

**Feature Commits:**

- `feat:`, `feature:`, `add:`, `create:`
- Group into "Features" section
- Use for primary PR type if majority

**Bug Fix Commits:**

- `fix:`, `bug:`, `resolve:`, `correct:`
- Group into "Bug Fixes" section
- Highlight security fixes prominently

**Refactoring Commits:**

- `refactor:`, `restructure:`, `reorganize:`, `extract:`
- Group into "Refactoring" section
- Mention performance improvements

**Documentation Commits:**

- `docs:`, `doc:`, `readme:`, `comment:`
- Group into "Documentation" section
- Note API documentation changes

**Configuration Commits:**

- `config:`, `env:`, `setup:`, `deps:`
- Group into "Configuration" section
- Note dependency changes

### Title Generation Examples

**Single Feature PR:**

```
feat: implement text2sql query validation system
```

**Bug Fix PR:**

```
fix: resolve PostgreSQL connection timeout issues
```

**Mixed Changes PR:**

```
refactor: enhance database schema and query validation
```

**Documentation PR:**

```
docs: update API documentation and setup guide
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Common Error Scenarios

**Authentication Issues:**

```bash
gh auth status || {
    echo "GitHub CLI not authenticated"
    echo "Run: gh auth login"
    exit 1
}
```

**Branch Already Has PR:**

```bash
EXISTING_PR=$(gh pr list --head $CURRENT_BRANCH --json number --jq '.[0].number')
if [ -n "$EXISTING_PR" ]; then
    echo "PR already exists for branch $CURRENT_BRANCH: #$EXISTING_PR"
    echo "View: gh pr view $EXISTING_PR"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Remote Branch Not Pushed:**

```bash
git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin $CURRENT_BRANCH || {
    echo "Current branch not pushed to remote"
    echo "Push first: git push -u origin $CURRENT_BRANCH"
    exit 1
}
```

### Recovery Options

```bash
# If PR creation fails, show manual commands
echo "PR creation failed. Manual creation commands:"
echo "gh pr create --title \"[manual title]\" --body \"[manual description]\""
echo "Or create via web interface: https://github.com/[repo]/compare/$TARGET_BRANCH...$CURRENT_BRANCH"
```

## Integration with Project Workflow

This PR command integrates seamlessly with the existing development workflow:

- **Commit Command Integration**: Works with commit messages from `/commit` command
- **Rebase Command Compatibility**: Can be used after `/rebase` to create clean PRs
- **NestJS Awareness**: Understands module structure for component-specific descriptions
- **TypeScript Integration**: Recognizes type-related changes and testing needs
- **Database Changes**: Identifies schema/migration changes for thorough validation

**Best Practices:**

1. **Clean Commits**: Use `/commit` command first for clean, analyzable commits
2. **Rebase First**: Consider `/rebase main` before creating PR for linear history
3. **Scope Coverage**: Ensure description covers all significant changes
4. **Component Focus**: Highlight specific modules or services affected
5. **Manual Review**: Always review generated title and description before approval

The command automatically handles pushing the current branch to remote if it hasn't been pushed yet, as part of the PR creation process.
